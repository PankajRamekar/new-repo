        <h2><b>Achievement</b></h2>
                <h3><i>Achievements are things you did that had a lasting impact for your company or 
                    client. It is a result that you personally bring about while fulfilling a particular
                    role. Typically they are things that you created, built, designed, sold or initiated.
                     It is not the same as responsibilities that come under a job description, as these
                      remain fixed no matter who is employed in the post.</i></h3>
