              <h4 style="color:teal;border:2px solid tomato;padding-left: 20px;"> <hr><i>Once upon a 
                  time, there was a Greek King, Midas.
                He was very <del>rich </del>and had lots of Gold. He had a daughter, who he loved a lot.
                One day, <em>Midas </em>found an                              angel in need of help.He 
                helped her and in return she agreed to grant a wish.
                Midas wished that everything                       he touched would turn into gold. His
                 wish was granted
                On his way                           home, he touched <ins>rocks and plants </ins>and they 
                turned into gold.
                As he reached home, in excitement he hugged his daughter, who turned into gold.
                Midas was devastated and he had learnt his lesson. Upon learning his lesson, Midas asked the
                 angel to take his wish away.</p>
