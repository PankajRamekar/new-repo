                <h3><i>The purpose of your resume is to communicate your qualifications and experience 
                    to a potential employer. The work experience section can help you showcase that you 
                    have the necessary skills to become an asset to the organisation. So, it is important
                    to outline your experience in such a way that it appeals to your potential employer
                    and shows that you can meet their expectations.</i></h3>
